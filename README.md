# Notes
This website is a work in progress. I know it's ugly right now.

## Objectives
- Calculate my own environmental footprint the best way I know how â€” utilizing the best data possible.
- Provide an overall glimpse of who I am, and how to get in touch with me
- Collect zero data about anyone who visits the website 
- Focus on making data files as small as possible

## Measurable metrics
- None. I worked too many years in marketing to ever want to see that shit again. This is a passion project. Fuck off.

## Hardware
